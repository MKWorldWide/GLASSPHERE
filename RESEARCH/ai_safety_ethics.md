## Oversight & Roles
- AthenaMist: Safety oversight, policy enforcement, anomalous event detection, emergency stop authority.
- Lilith.Eve: Grid/operations management within policy bounds and rate limits.

- Reversibility: Start and stay within reversible, low‑energy envelopes.

## Controls
- Hard limits on field intensity, duration, and duty cycle; automatic aborts.
- Dual‑channel authorization for stimulations (human + AI safety guard).
- Immutable logging (hashes, time sync) and independent backups.

## Data Governance
- Minimize PII; anonymize locations when appropriate.
- Versioned datasets with checksums and provenance; share under clear license.
- Security scanning in CI; secrets management; least‑privilege access.
