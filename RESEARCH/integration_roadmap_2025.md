# Unified Integration Roadmap — 2025

Status: Active Development

## Goals
- Deliver a lean, testable research stack with docs and CI.
- Run PNAP v1.1 non‑invasive field sessions under strict safety gates.
- Publish anonymized datasets and clear methods.

## Timeline
- Q3
  - Lean setup complete (minimal reqs, smoke tests, Pages) — DONE
  - PNAP v1.1 protocol freeze; site permissions and logistics
  - IR demo hardening; small‑frame render performance checks
- Q4
  - PNAP micro‑stimulation trials (selected sites; limited windows)
  - Cross‑site correlation & sensitivity analysis
  - Public release: datasets, calibration notes, safety audits, revised docs

## Deliverables
- PNAP v1.1 protocol and safety checklist
- Site baseline datasets + stimulation response traces
- Documentation site (MkDocs, gh‑pages) with API and methods
- Peer review packet (methods, data dictionary, sample analyses)

## Gates
- Ethics & Heritage approval per site
- Instrument calibration certification
- Real‑time abort testing completed
