- Added Flake8 and isort for Python code quality
- Added mypy for static type checking
- Added Ruff for additional Python linting

### 3. Documentation
- Enhanced MkDocs configuration
- Set up automated documentation deployment
- Added support for versioned documentation

### 4. Development Environment
- Updated .gitignore with comprehensive patterns
- Added .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Standardized Python version management

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Developers

1. **Update Python Version**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed (recommended using pyenv)
   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.11.0
   pyenv local 3.11.0
   ```

2. **Set Up Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. **Install Development Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Pre-commit Hooks Manually**
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

### For CI/CD

1. **Required Secrets**
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN`: For code coverage reporting
   - `SAFETY_API_KEY`: For dependency vulnerability scanning (optional)

2. **Environment Variables**
   - `PYTHON_VERSION`: Set to 3.11
   - `NODE_VERSION`: Set to 20

## Breaking Changes

1. **Python Version**
   - Minimum Python version is now 3.9
   - Recommended Python version is 3.11

2. **Dependencies**
   - Updated all major dependencies to their latest stable versions
   - Removed deprecated packages

3. **Code Style**
   - Enforced Black code formatting
   - Added type hints throughout the codebase

## Known Issues

- Some tests may fail due to the updated dependencies. These should be addressed on a case-by-case basis.
- Documentation may need to be updated to reflect any API changes.

## Rollback Instructions

To rollback to the previous version:

1. Revert the Git commit:
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

2. Force push to update the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

## Support

For any issues or questions, please open an issue in the repository or contact the maintainers.
