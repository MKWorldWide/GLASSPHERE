# Research Methodology

Status: Active Development

- Scientific framing: non‑invasive measurements first; reversible, low‑energy stimulation.
- Protocol: PNAP v1.1 (see RESEARCH/pnap_protocol_v1.1.md).
- Reproducibility: standardized kit, calibration, time sync, data schema.
- Ethics: AthenaMist oversight and independent safety officer sign‑off.
