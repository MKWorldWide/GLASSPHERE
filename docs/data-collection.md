# Data Collection Procedures

Status: Active Development

## Minimal Records
- Site metadata and consent artifacts
- Baselines (EM, magnetic, acoustic, weather)
- Stimulation parameters (freq, amplitude, duty, duration)
- Responses (peaks, notes), checksums

## Storage
- Normalized tables + referenced raw traces by checksum
- Minimal JSON samples included in PNAP v1.1 and schema docs
